# 🎥 UnlockPack.AI – 1-Minute Hackathon Pitch

## 🧑‍💻 Introdução (00–10s)**
Hi there, I’m Vinicius, and this is **UnlockPack.AI** — a platform that helps students access powerful tools and opportunities online.

## 🧩 Problem (10–20s)

Most students don’t even know they have access to dozens of tools — like GitHub Pro, Azure, and Figma — and many more - all for free.

We’re here to help close that gap.

But just listing what's available isn’t enough.

We want to show students how to **actually build** with these top professional tools —  
using open source projects they can clone and customize.

## 🚀 Solução (20–45s)
UnlockPack.AI guides students through the process: exploring benefits, unlocking with a few clicks, and keeping track of what’s been used.

But it’s not just about unlocking perks —  
**we show how to build with them**, using open source GitHub repos, for free.

## 🌱 Impacto (45–55s)
With over **$82,000 DOLLARS in student benefits**, UnlockPack is turning credits into real learning experiences, project by project.

## 🔚 Fechamento (55–60s)
This is UnlockPack.AI — explore, unlock, and start building your future.
